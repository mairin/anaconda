/* Define styles to apply to the GtkLevelBar widgets for different values.
 *
 * This stylesheet defines properties for "low", "medium" and "high" level bar
 * levels. The level bars themselves need to define what style applies at what
 * value using gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value. Gtk defines "low" and "high" by
 * default, but it defines them for level bars using a continuous value between
 * 0 and 1, so our discrete level bars are effectively always at the "high"
 * level.
 *
 * Fun surprises that might change in future versions:
 *
 *  - Defining properties for a level will set properties on both the filled
 *    portion and the empty portion of the level bar. So if all of the display
 *    properties are set, which we do, the level bar effectively becomes 100%
 *    filled with whatever properties are set. Copying the .empty-fill-block
 *    properties from the theme so that they apply at the application level
 *    works around this.
 *
 *  - There's a bug in the handling of the maximum offset in that it only
 *    applies when value == max-value, rather than when it's between
 *    max-value and the next lower offset. For example, consider a
 *    discrete-mode level bar with a max-value of 4 and offsets defined as
 *    "low": 2.0, "medium": 3.0 and "high": 4.0. Value 1 will be low,
 *    value 2 will be medium, value 3 will be in an undefined no-man's land,
 *    and value 4 will be high. To get around this we re-define the default
 *    fill-block values as the same as fill-block.level-high.
 *
 *  - The GNOME Adwaita theme applies a gradient to the progress bar when the
 *    window is focused. It does this by redefining the colors in a
 *    background-image property, so unless we reset background-image our colors
 *    will only apply when the window is out of focus, which uses the :backdrop
 *    selector.
